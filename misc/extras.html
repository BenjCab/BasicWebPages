    <h1>Extras extras</h1>
    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may
   also be interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or
   <a href='../images.html'>images</a>.</p>

   <h2>Character Sets</h2>
    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>bir</li>
      <li>iki</li>
      <li>üç</li>
      <li>dört</li>
      <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

    <p>i was supposed to see some funky stuff but everything is fine, i guess google chrome handle it without much need of programming, even though i will add the meta element just for the exercise sake</p>
  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
   should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
   <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
   yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
